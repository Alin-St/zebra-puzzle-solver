# Zebra Puzzle Solver

This is a C# console application that helps you solve the [Zebra Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) by brute force.

The program is based on an adaptation of the problem prezented in [this video](https://youtu.be/cKRAH2maFis) by MindYourDecisions.

### How it works?

The program tries to generate all possible grids (solutions) using recursivity, cell by cell. At each step it checks the list of conditions given in the problem before continuing.
